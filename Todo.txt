            //Need to be able to send a list of metrics to graphite. 
            //Refacto plaintestmessage to accept a list of type metric 
            //Need to create IMetric with types for float int etc. 
            //and return the byte array. 
            //Create a branch for this. 
            //Also finish the check for config updated 
            //Also make the installer correct to not use ilmerge
